2020/2/3,Fringe laboratory leak theory debunked,"A scientist from the Wuhan Institute of Virology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has debunked a recent conspiracy theory that claimed the novel coronavirus was manufactured and escaped from the institute's most advanced biocontainment facility.
Shi Zhengli, a researcher from the institute, said on social media on Sunday that the virus was the result of ""nature punishing the uncivilized habits and customs of humans"", and she is willing to ""bet my life that it has nothing to do with the lab"".
Shi was the lead scientist in the discovery that the novel coronavirus can enter cells through the ACE2 receptors and may have originated in bats.
Her comments came after Indian scientists recently published a non-peer-reviewed paper suggesting that scientists had artificially inserted genes from the HIV virus into the coronavirus, thus making it susceptible to anti-HIV treatments.
The paper was immediately panned by experts around the world and was removed on Sunday from the server of bioRxiv, a biology journal repository.
In a twitter post commenting on the paper, David Liu, a chemistry professor at Harvard University, said: ""The mere claim that such short inserts support nCoV origins 'unlikely to be fortuitous in nature' is already highly suspect.""
The term nCoV refers to the novel coronavirus.
""This is a classic case of searching for lost keys only under a lamppost,"" Liu said. ""A fearful world does not need to fuel conspiracy theories with bad analyses.""
The Indian article was widely cited by conspiracy media outlets as proof that Chinese scientists had engineered the virus and that it had escaped from the institute's biosafety level-IV laboratory, the highest biohazard precaution standards designed to contain and study the world's most dangerous pathogens, including Ebola, smallpox, Lassa fever and Marburg virus.
The conspiracy theory began in late January when British tabloid the Daily Mail and the Washington Times, a conservative US newspaper, published articles claiming the recent outbreak could be the accidental result of secret biological weapons research in China.
Though the articles provided no evidence, the fringe theory quickly went viral on social media, prompting media outlets from the BBC to Foreign Policy to speak up against it.
On Jan 28, the Chinese embassy in Italy said in a statement that the theory is baseless, false reporting.
""China will continue to maintain an open, transparent and highly responsible attitude when publishing information regarding the outbreak,"" it said.
""While strengthening outbreak prevention and control, China will continue to deepen international cooperation and tackle the disease together with the international community and jointly maintain the safety and health of the region and the world.""","ACE2,Wuhan,novel coronavirus,Washington,Italy,China,US,coronavirus,outbreak,pathogens,susceptible"
2020/2/6,Researcher plays down talk of anti-virus drug success,"Too early to draw conclusions, says hospital chief. A drug undergoing clinical research at a hospital in Wuhan, Hubei province, has not yet proven to be effective in treating the novel coronavirus, despite rumors to the contrary, a scientist in charge of the research has said.Remdesivir, a drug being developed by United States-based pharmaceutical company Gilead, was being tested to see whether it could be used to treat patients with pneumonia caused by the virus in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, in Wuhan, the outbreak epicenter, on Wednesday.On Thursday evening rumors began spreading online saying the first day of trial had achieved a remarkable effect on 761 patients participating in the research.But Cao Bin, vice-president of the China-Japan Friendship Hospital, dismissed this, saying research has only just started and no results have been achieved yet, according to a report by China Youth Daily.In a statement at the end of last month, Gilead said Remdesivir had not gained approval to enter the market in any country, and its safety and effectiveness had not been proven.","Wuhan,novel coronavirus,Japan,China,coronavirus,outbreak,Hubei province"

2020/2/7,Has the CCDC withheld info on the novel coronavirus outbreak?,"A paper about the novel coronavirus published in The New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday (Jan 29) has sparked a storm of criticism among Chinese netizens, some of whom claim the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has withheld important information about the outbreak. In the paper, a team of Chinese researchers, including those from the center, drew on data from 425 confirmed cases as of Jan 23 and stated ""there is evidence human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019."" The conclusion has led some people to believe such evidence had already been discovered by Chinese researchers in December. Some have accused researchers and CDC officials of intentionally covering up the risk of transmission among people out of self-interest to gain academic clout. Is the allegation true? ""The conclusion is a deduction based on a retrospective study that looks back on epidemiology research of infected cases,"" the CDC said in a statement, reaffirming the risk of the virus spreading among people was not discovered at the onset of the outbreak in December. The center said information about the 425 cases analyzed in the paper, including the infection of 15 medical workers, had already been released to the public before researchers conducted the study. Evidence of person-to-person transmission of the coronavirus during the outbreak was first disclosed to the public by Zhong Nanshan - who leads a senior-level expert team convened by the National Health Commission - on Jan 20, before studies associated with the paper began. The center added the prompt release of research results on the virus in academic journals is meant to share the latest information with scientists in China and abroad, joining efforts to evaluate the outbreak and improve control measures.","confirmed,cases,novel coronavirus,transmission,who,China,coronavirus,outbreak"

This protects you against common bacteria such as E. coli and salmonella that can pass between pets and humans.",coronavirus
2020/2/8,Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?,"The fact is, vaccines such as the pneumococcal vaccine and the Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine do not provide protection against the new coronavirus. The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and the World Health Organization is supporting their efforts.","World Health Organization,coronavirus"
2020/2/8,Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?,"The fact is, there is some limited evidence regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infection.",
2020/2/8,Can gargling mouthwash protect you from infection with the new coronavirus?,"The fact is, some brands of mouthwash can eliminate certain microbes for a few minutes in the saliva in your mouth. However, this does not mean they protect you from 2019-nCoV.",

2020/2/8,Does putting on sesame oil block the new coronavirus from entering the body?,"The fact is, sesame oil does not kill the new coronavirus. There are some chemical disinfectants that can kill the 2019-nCoV on surfaces. These include bleach/chlorine-based disinfectants, solvents, 75% ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform. However, they have little or no impact on the virus if you put them on the skin or under your nose. It can even be dangerous to put these chemicals on your skin.",coronavirus
2020/2/8,Can sun exposure kill the novel coronavirus?,"Sun exposure cannot kill the novel coronavirus. The irradiation temperature of the sun cannot reach 56 C, and the ultraviolet rays cannot reach the intensity of ultraviolet lamps, so the virus can't be killed by the sun.If you want to go out for a sun bath, please wear a mask and take other protective measures.",coronavirus
2020/2/8,"Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?","The fact is, people of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus. Older people and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes and heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves.","WHO,coronavirus,heart disease"
2020/2/8,Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?,"The fact is, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus, and therefore antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible.","treatment,coronavirus"
2020/2/8,Can taking a hot bath or using air conditioning kill the novel coronavirus?,"Taking a hot bath or blowing air conditioning cannot kill the novel coronavirus. Although the novel coronavirus is vulnerable to heat, it can only be effectively inactivated after exposure to a 56 C temperature for over 30 minutes. Your normal body temperature remains around 36.5°„C to 37°„C, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. Actually, taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.","COVID-19,coronavirus,novel coronavirus"
2020/2/8,"The higher the concentration of alcohol, the more effective a disinfectant is?","Ethanol at a concentration of 60 to 80 percent proves to be an effective antiseptic, which can deactivate all lipophilic viruses and many hydrophilic viruses. However, 90 percent alcohol concentration may reduce the effectiveness of disinfection, because the chance of mutation for protein - a major substance contained in the virus - is less without water.",
2020/2/8,Can fur collars attract viruses more easily?,"It's a misconception that fur collars can attract viruses more easily. Due to the nature of the influenza virus, the virus prefers smooth, non-porous surfaces and has a shorter retention time on woolen fabrics. At home or before going out, it is not necessary to consider which kind of material has less chance to absorb the virus - choosing comfortable clothes is enough. After returning home, please wash your hands, sterilize the clothes and blow the clothes with a dryer.",
2020/2/10,"Aerosol, fecal routes of infection unconfirmed","The National Health Commission reiterated on Sunday that the transmission routes of the novel coronavirus through aerosols and digestive tracts have yet to be confirmed. ""So far, we've made clear that the transmission routes of the novel coronavirus are through droplets and contacts, and the other transmission routes, such as through aerosol and fecal-oral, need to be further clarified,"" the commission said during a media briefing. In a post on its WeChat account on Sunday it said, ""Most confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus pneumonia can be traced to close contact with previously confirmed patients, according to our epidemiological investigations."" In the fifth edition of the diagnosis and treatment plans for NCP, released on Saturday, the commission said the transmission routes of the virus through aerosols and digestive tracts had not been identified. Experts explained that aerosols refer to liquid or small particles suspended in the air. People exhale aerosols all the time, from breathing and talking to singing and sneezing. They added that the diameter of droplets produced by talking or sneezing is usually more than 1 millimeter while that of aerosols is less than 0.1 mm. ""Being much smaller, aerosols won't drop to the surface of something or to the ground immediately. Instead, they will linger in the air for as long as several days,"" said Wang Minghuai, a professor from the School of Atmospheric Sciences at Nanjing University in Jiangsu province. Doctors said that many viruses causing respiratory diseases are transmitted via aerosols, but that such transmission happens only rarely in open areas as there are various substances in the air, including ultraviolet rays and free radicals with strong oxidation properties that will largely reduce the toxicity, while their density is naturally diluted in the air. So people will only get infected by a virus through aerosol transmission when they enter an enclosed space, such as an elevator recently vacated by an infected person who coughed a lot, doctors said. They reminded people to wear face masks at all times in public places and to avoid poorly ventilated places as much as possible. Cao Junji, director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Key Laboratory of Aerosol Chemistry and Physics, reminded people to maintain ventilation or use air purifiers when at home or in the office to reduce possible virus concentrations in the air. Shen Yinzhong, director of infectious diseases at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, said the aerosol transmission route posed a greater health threat to front-line medical workers than the general public as the use of some medical devices, including respirators and atomizers, generated aerosols.","confirmed,cases,transmission,infectious diseases,Public Health,who,epidemiological,coronavirus,treatment"
2020/2/10,Can the virus be caught from people with no symptoms?,"The fact is that people who have symptoms have caused the majority of the spread of the virus. Based on the observation of MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), it is rare for infected patients showing no symptoms to spread the coronavirus to others.","who,coronavirus"
2020/2/10,Spraying ethanol or chlorine kills the virus?,"The fact is, spraying ethanol or chlorine all over the body does not kill viruses that have already entered into the body. Instead, it may be harmful to spray such substances over clothing or mucous membranes (eyes, mouth). Ethanol and chlorine may be useful for the surface disinfection of various objects, but people should follow recommendations when using them.",
2020/2/10,Can using hand dryer kill the new coronavirus?,"The fact is, a hand dryer cannot effectively kill the new coronavirus. To protect yourself from the disease, you should always wash your hands with an ethanol-based hand sanitizer or soap and water. After washing your hands, dry them thoroughly by paper towels or a warm air dryer.",coronavirus

2020/2/11,Is novel coronavirus a type of SARS?,"Experts debunked the claim that the novel coronavirus is a type of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus, which has caused unnecessary panic on Chinese social media. The novel coronavirus may share some genetic similarities with the SARS virus£≠both use the same ACE2 receptor to enter cells, for example£≠but it is inaccurate to say novel coronavirus is a type of SARS virus, they said. The controversy began on Sunday night when virologist Chen Huanchun made the claim, which quickly went viral on Chinese social media and led to scientists scrambling to refute it. Chen later apologized for the error in speaking, saying he intended to say both viruses belong to the same broad category£≠both are beta coronaviruses, one of the four major genera of the coronaviruses first discovered in 1968. The SARS epidemic between 2002 and 2003 still strikes a sensitive nerve in the Chinese public since it was the first viral outbreak in the 21st century to seriously challenge the nation's public health infrastructure and response mechanisms. SARS's visible symptoms are also more serious, and it has a higher death rate, around 9.6 percent, than novel coronavirus, which is estimated to be around 2 to 4 percent, according to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. As a result, scientists have been very careful when comparing the two coronaviruses. Zhong Nanshan, the leading expert spearheading China's epidemic response, was the first scientist to speak out against Chen's claim. ""The novel coronavirus belongs to a parallel classification of the SARS virus,"" he said. ""They may belong to the same category, but they are not the same species. They are very different."" Of all the coronaviruses discovered, only seven can infect humans, according to the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Four are alpha coronaviruses, and the other three are beta coronaviruses such as SARS, novel coronavirus and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS. According to the journal Lancet, novel coronavirus and SARS share about 79 percent of their genetic sequence, meaning they are related but are very distant organisms. In comparison, humans share 96 percent of their genes with chimpanzees and 80 percent with cows, according to the National Human Genome Research Institute.","ACE2,novel coronavirus,public health,China,coronavirus,outbreak,epidemic"
2020/2/11,Can disposable face masks be reused?,"The fact is a face mask is less effective in preventing the virus after being disinfected through spraying alcohol. However, in places where the epidemic is less severe, disposable face masks can be reused as long as its inner layer is unsoiled. After each use, a face mask should be put in a clean place with good ventilation.",epidemic
2020/2/12,Are Chinese more vulnerable to novel coronavirus?,"At a Feb 7 news conference held by the White House response team for the novel coronavirus outbreak, a journalist asked, ""Are Chinese more likely to be infected by the novel coronavirus pneumonia?"" Anthony S. Fauci, director doctor of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the United States National Institutes of Health, said most cases of the novel coronavirus have indeed been found in China, but there haven't been any findings about which groups are more vulnerable. He said that after reviewing the infection history of respiratory viruses, there has never been evidence showing Asian ethnic groups are more vulnerable to the novel coronavirus.","cases,novel coronavirus,pneumonia,China,coronavirus,outbreak,Infectious Diseases"
2020/2/12,Will recovered patients suffer severe side effects?,"One rumor claims patients who have recovered from the novel coronavirus will suffer chronic side effects, worse than those seen in SARS survivors. Zhan Qingyuan, head of an expert team for pneumonia control at China-Japan Friendship Hospital, said there should be no chronic side effects for patients with mild symptoms. Those with severe symptoms may experience pulmonary fibrosis, he said. He said most of the problems will be addressed thanks to the ability of the lung to repair itself, though symptoms may linger for an extended period of time in a tiny minority of patients with extremely severe cases.","cases,Japan,who,China,coronavirus"
2020/2/13,Are goggles necessary when going out?,"It is alleged that during the outbreak of the novel coronavirus people should wear goggles when away from home. The public has no need to wear goggles, said Li Lanjuan, a renowned Chinese epidemiologist. Only doctors at the front lines of the outbreak should wear protective goggles or masks when diagnosing and treating infected patients, said Li. The infection rate via the eyes is tiny. At present, there is no need for people to wear goggles - the more important is regular  hand-washing and no eye-rubbing, she said. ","outbreak,coronavirus,novel coronavirus"
2020/2/13,Contact lens must not be worn during outbreak?,"In fact, contact lenses can be used as long as they are kept clean, said Ye Jian, an ophthalmologist of Daping Hospital in Chongqing municipality.

But in cases where someone shows symptoms, such as coughing and eye discomfort, or has contacted with an infected person, stop using contact lens, and go see a doctor.",cases
2020/2/14,Novel coronavirus detected on banknotes?,"As a carrier, a banknote has a tiny possibility of being contaminated by the virus, and the probability for the virus' survival on a banknote also is low, said Zheng Xiaoyan, an epidemiologist at the Fuzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention. ""Thus there is a rather small possibility of virus transmission via a banknote,"" he said. So far, major infection sources are patients contracting novel coronavirus pneumonia, Zhang said. ",coronavirus
2020/2/14,Virus travels via wind?,"The major routes of transmission are still through droplets and direct contact, as per the latest explanation released on the WeChat account of China's National Health Commission on Feb 9. Epidemiological surveys showed most cases could be traced back to close contact with confirmed patients. The National Health Commission said, for now, the distance for droplet transmission is not rather long, usually shorter than two meters. Droplets with a diameter larger than five micrometers will settle quickly by coughing or during talking, in case of close distance, on mucous membrane of the exposed, resulting in infection. But droplets don't float long in air, and won't be blown far enough to serve as virus carriers.","China,cases,confirmed"
2020/2/15,Can smoking prevent novel coronavirus?,"An article recently circulating on China's social media platform WeChat claimed smokers have been infected by the novel coronavirus pneumonia at a far lower rate than non-smokers. The article posted on the WeChat public account Yaojiang Yaoshuo Ketang made the conclusion based on data published in a paper on clinical symptoms of patients infected with the novel coronavirus, co-authored by experts including Zhong Nanshan, a renowned respiratory scientist. According to the data in the paper, among 1,099 pneumonia patients surveyed, 927 were non-smokers, accounting for 85.4 percent of the total; 21 had a history of smoking, accounting for 1.9 percent; and 137 were smokers, accounting for 12.6 percent. A slew of health experts refuted the conclusion, saying it is a rumor taken out of context. ""Composition ratio of infected cases is a different concept than infection ratio of the generation population,"" said Wang Ke'an, former director of the Thinktank Research Center for Health Development. The paper analyzed the composition ratio of infected cases, or the proportions of smokers and non-smokers in the patients. The claim that smokers' infection rate is lower than that of nonsmokers is a disguised replacement of concepts, he said. Zhang Jianshu, president of the Beijing Cigarette Control Association, said the writer of the article took advantage of public panic over the novel coronavirus to promote the tobacco industry. Zhang Ye, head physician at the pneumology department of Beijing Hepingli Hospital, said so far there have been no findings or data showing nicotine, a major element in cigarettes, has an anti-viral effect or prevents infections. Zhang said nicotine can cause respiratory failure and paralysis. As has been known, smoking harms people's health. It weakens the immune system, accelerates the onset of senility and worsens diabetes and blood pressure, among other things.","cases,Beijing,novel coronavirus,pneumonia,China,department,Wang Ke'an,immune system,coronavirus,Cigarette Control"

As Wuhan, epicenter of the outbreak, is hit by rainy and snowy weather on Friday and Saturday, some online rumors claimed Huoshenshan Hospital has been ""blown away"" and that severe rain leakage occurred.  Rumors also said some patients from the hospital, which was constructed in only 10 days, have to be transferred to other medical institutes because of the incident.  In a media release on Saturday, the Wuhan construction authority said quite the contrary, that the hospital has been operating normally since it was put into operation on Feb 4. It also said rain leakage featured in an online video didn't happen in the hospital, but Leishenshan, the second makeshift hospital built in Wuhan for virus control.  ""It happened in a zone that has not been transferred for operation,"" it said, adding workers have been busy repairing the area.

On Sunday, a screen shot of a WeChat conversation among medical workers from the Southeast Hospital went viral on social media. It showed a picture of a hole in what appeared to be a wall of a ward. ""Dr Wang is chasing after him,"" a medical worker wrote in the conversation. Rumors then began to circulate on social media and caused widespread panic. Some said a confirmed NCP patient escaped while some claimed that eight people fled the hospital. The hospital has been designated to keep suspected NCP patients in Xiaogan since the outbreak. The patient, surnamed Wang, was then sent to the hospital for isolation. The 34-year-old dug a hole on the board installed to separate the ward around noon on Sunday. He then escaped by climbing out of a window, the hospital said in a statement on Monday. About 12:20 pm, the patient was found.

According to the statement posted on the institute's website, Chen expressed great indignation over the false use of her identity in a rumor.  On Monday, a rumor went viral online saying Chen reported Wang Yanyi, director of the institute, as leaking the novel coronavirus. Chen's ID number was also attached to a screenshot along with the rumor, which claimed Wang is the culprit responsible for the epidemic, and often takes experimental animals out of the laboratory and sells them at the Huanan Seafood Market, where the novel coronavirus outbreak was first reported. According to the institute's website, Chen has been working on influenza viruses at the institute since 2001. It is not the first time the Wuhan Institute of Virology has been targeted by conspiracy theories. Earlier this month, Shi Zhengli, a researcher at the institute, debunked a rumor that claimed that the novel coronavirus was manufactured and escaped from the institute's most advanced biocontainment lab.

2020/2/19,Global experts condemn virus conspiracy against China,"In an open letter published in the British medical journal Lancet on Tuesday, a group of health experts from across the world condemned conspiracy theories surrounding the contagious novel coronavirus, which broke out in Central China's Wuhan, and voiced support for Chinese health workers. ""We sign this statement in solidarity with all scientists and health professionals in China who continue to save lives and protect global health during the challenge of the COVID-19 outbreak,"" read the letter. In the letter the health experts condemned conspiracy theories suggesting that the novel coronavirus pneumonia, or COVID-19, does not have a natural origin. It said ""scientists from multiple countries have published and analyzed genomes of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), and they overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife, as have many other emerging pathogens."" Since the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia, which has been named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization, rumors and disinformation have shrouded truth about the disease. One of the widely-circulated rumors was seen in a Washington Times article on Jan 24, which claimed the virus was part of Chinese biological weapons program based at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The institute is home to China's first biosafety level-IV lab, which studies world's most dangerous pathogens including Ebola, Lassa fever and Marburg virus. There was also an Indian article claiming scientists had artificially inserted genes from the HIV virus into the coronavirus, thus making it susceptible to anti-HIV treatments. The article was widely cited by conspiracy media outlets as proof that Chinese scientists had engineered the virus and that it had escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The letter was signed by 27 health experts from eight countries, including Jeremy Farrar, a British medical researcher, and Jim Hughes, an infectious disease expert formerly working for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The letter said Chinese scientists and health professionals ""have worked diligently and effectively to rapidly identify the pathogen behind the outbreak, put in place significant measures to reduce its impact, and share their results transparently with the global health community."" ""Rapid, open and transparent sharing of data on the outbreak is being threatened by rumors and misinformation around its origins"", read the letter. A petition to spread awareness of the letter and its agenda began on Change.org on Wednesday and it has been close to reaching its goal of 500 signatories as of 6:30pm the same day.","Wuhan,novel coronavirus,susceptible,Washington,pneumonia,World Health Organization,who,COVID-19,China,US,coronavirus,outbreak,pathogens,syndrome coronavirus 2"

According to Ruan Guangfeng from China Food Information Center, the saying that vitamin C helps improve immunity originates from people's knowledge about colds, which is scientifically groundless. There is no proof that vitamin C relieves or cures colds. Ruan said it is not necessary for healthy people to take extra supplements to prevent the disease as long as they get enough nutrition from a balanced diet.  As for those who stay at home during the epidemic control, Ruan suggests taking vitamin C if fresh vegetables and fruit are temporarily unavailable - 100 milligrams for adults and no more than 200 milligrams for those who are pregnant.

2020/2/21,Is Wuhan Institute of Virology responsible for the virus outbreak?,"Recent rumors and misinformation targeting the Wuhan Institute of Virology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have seriously disturbed its research against the novel coronavirus epidemic, but it has ""a clear conscience and no regrets"" and will remain steadfast in continuing its work to fight the virus, the institute said in a public letter late on Wednesday. Established in 1956, the institute, which is the top virology research agency in China and home to Asia's highest-level biosafety lab, has been besieged by rumors and controversies since the outbreak. These rumors included the virus being artificially engineered or leaked from the institute's P4 biosecurity lab. They also attacked the institute's leaders and its staff, claiming the first patient of the virus was one of its graduate students and questioning the competence of its director. ""These rumors have seriously harmed our researchers at the front line and have seriously disrupted our institute's research mission to combat the epidemic,"" the letter said. The letter said its researchers have worked tirelessly, overcome many obstacles and produced numerous crucial and timely discoveries, including publishing the full genome of the virus, identifying viral strains for vaccine and drug development, creating animal test models and diagnosing patients. ""Looking back at all the hard work we have done in the past month, we have a clear conscience and no regrets,"" it said.""Research is the front line against the epidemic. Let us firm our resolve, tune out distractions and jointly devote ourselves to our research and our work."" Over the past week, the institute issued multiple statements refuting rumors implying the institute was responsible for the novel coronavirus outbreak first discovered in Wuhan. On Monday, Chen Quanjiao, a researcher from the institute, refuted a conspiracy theory posted by Sina Weibo user ""Weiketiezhi"" who claimed that Chen had reported the head of the institute Wang Yanyi for selling experimental animals and leaking the virus from a lab. ""I never released any information reporting others and I'm very angry at those who impersonated me to fabricate a false message,""Chen said in her statement published on the institute's website. Chen added she will hold the rumor monger legally liable. The World Health Organization's Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean said in a news briefing on Wednesday that the virus came from animals, and there is no evidence to support that it came from a lab. Local cybersecurity authorities in Jiangsu province released a public statement on Monday saying they have traced the account spreading the rumor to an overseas IP and an organization that specializes in propagating anti-China content. ""Netizens should keep their eyes open and not be misled by others,"" it said. It is either bad intentions or absurd ignorance that has led certain individuals and media outlets to publish sensational statements that suggest the novel coronavirus is a bioweapon leaked from a lab, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Thursday. Geng mentioned the joint statement signed by 27 of the world's leading scientists in the field of public health and published by the journal Lancet in support of the Chinese researchers, healthcare workers and medics fighting the outbreak. The statement strongly condemns the conspiracy theories about the outbreak circulating on the internet. ""We're not just battling the virus, but also conspiracy theories,"" Geng said, noting that what is needed in the face of an epidemic is science, reason and cooperation. ""We must seek the triumph of science over ignorance, dispel rumors with truth and replace prejudice with cooperation,"" he said at the ministry's online news conference. China hopes that the international community will continue to work together against conspiracy theories and other ""political viruses"" while combating the novel coronavirus, Geng added.","Wuhan,us,novel coronavirus,public health,World Health Organization,who,China,coronavirus,epidemic,outbreak"
2020/2/21,Can novel coronavirus enter the body through skin?,"In fact, the novel coronavirus is unlikely to enter the human body through the skin. It is mainly spread through respiratory droplets and direct contact with a carrier.  Washing your hands properly and frequently is an effective way to avoid virus transmission, according to Zhou Qi, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.","coronavirus,novel coronavirus"
2020/2/21,Community clarifies misunderstanding on virus relapse,"Inappropriate wording in an epidemic notice released in a residential community in Wuhan misled people to believe two cured patients of the novel coronavirus pneumonia have relapsed, causing unexpected panic. According to the notice released by the Dahua residential community in Hongshan street on Thursday, ""There are two newly confirmed cases and one suspected case today, all patients who have recovered from the disease."" This caused panic among people, as many believe it is proof of a possible relapse of the contagious disease. In response, the community management committee released an announcement on Thursday stating it was a misunderstanding caused by wrong usage of words by the community employee in charge of updating the epidemic situation. It said the ""two newly confirmed cases"" mentioned in the notice are recovered NCP patients who have been discharged from hospital and are staying at home under quarantine, and the ""one suspected case"" is a patient who has seen improved conditions and has tested negative for the novel coronavirus two consecutive times. It said due to a change in the statistical method of counting, the employee in question included in the daily update the three cases, which were not calculated previously, ""to make the statistics more complete"". The committee apologized for the negative impact the mistake had caused. According to experts, cured NCP patients are advised to stay home for a 14-day isolation period after getting discharged from the hospital in case of a relapse. According to media reports, a recovered NCP patient in Chengdu, Sichuan province was found to have relapsed on Feb 19. The person saw a positive test for the virus during the 10th day of home isolation after recovering from the disease. The news has been confirmed by the province's health authority.","confirmed,Wuhan,contagious,cases,who,coronavirus,epidemic"
2020/2/22,Recycled subway tickets can transmit novel coronavirus?,"The major routes of transmission are still through respiratory droplets and direct contact, so it's highly unlikely that recycled subway tickets are contaminated with the virus, according to Feng Luzhao, an analyst from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Wearing a mask and keeping your hands clean are effective ways to prevent viral infections in daily life. Besides, when going out on the subway, people are encouraged to use a personal transportation card or pay for the ticket via an app. After taking public transportation, washing hands is necessary.",

However, the World Health Organization noted on Saturday there is no evidence or proof yet showing the virus can be transmitted this way. According to WHO, the novel coronavirus is a respiratory virus, which spreads primarily through contact with an infected person via respiratory droplets generated when he or she coughs or sneezes, or via droplet discharge from the nose. The WHO stressed it's important for people to wash their hands regularly with either alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. Avoiding direct contact with those who are coughing and sneezing is also recommended.","WHO,novel coronavirus,World Health Organization,who,coronavirus"

2020/2/26,Will hormone therapy leave patients disabled?,"Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia, there is a rumor saying that hormone treatments used on patients will cause severe side-effects, even leaving them disabled. The rumor arose mainly because during the 2003 SARS epidemic, a large number of patients received injections of glucocorticoids - hormones that inhibit inflammation - to treat the disease. Despite the immediate curative effects, the therapy left many patients who survived the disease struggling with physical problems, such as femoral head necrosis, a skeletal disease that corrodes hipbones beyond repair, in the following years. Zhao Jianping, a respiratory expert at Wuhan Union Hospital, said in a previous report that Chinese medical experts had reached consensus on less use of hormones when treating novel coronavirus patients. ""Due to a lack of knowledge, the amount of hormones used on SARS patients was quite heavy for a prolonged period. Now, we have agreed to avoid using excessive amounts of hormones,"" he was quoted as saying. According to the latest version of the guideline on diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia released by the National Health Commission, doctors should be quite careful and cautious in the application of glucocorticoids to patients infected with the virus. For severe cases and critically ill patients, a limited amount of glucocorticoids can be used in a short period (3-5 days) based on the patient's condition, according to the guideline. So, will the recovered patients suffer from side-effects?  Wang Fusheng, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said even for severe patients, if they receive timely treatments, there will be few chronic side-effects. So far there is no effective medication for the virus, and a person's own immune system plays a critical role in fighting against the virus, said Zhou Xin, a respiratory expert with Shanghai General Hospital. What medical workers can do is to support the immune system and maintain the body's normal functions through the use of life-support equipment, such as ventilators, thus buying time for the body to regain strength and fight off the disease, he said.","Wuhan,cases,novel coronavirus,pneumonia,who,immune system,coronavirus,outbreak,epidemic,treatment"
2020/2/26,Does wearing more than one surgical mask help prevent infection from the virus?,"According to medical experts, people can protect themselves if they wear a mask correctly. Wearing additional ones will not work, but will be a waste of resources and may even make it more difficult to breathe.",
2020/2/27,Do clothes transmit virus?,"The novel coronavirus is unlikely to be transmitted by clothing. And there is no need to disinfect clothes with alcohol if ordinary people haven't gone to the hospital, visited patients or had direct contact with suspected cases, according to Feng Luzhao, an analyst from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Alcohol has no corrosive effect on ordinary clothing. However, it is highly flammable and may catch fire due to high temperature, open fires or static electricity. Therefore, spraying medical alcohol directly on clothing is not recommended.","cases,coronavirus,novel coronavirus"
2020/2/28,"Should we disinfect shoe soles, delivery packages and others?","A senior official of Beijing's disease control authority said the public does not need to disinfect things like vehicle tires, air in corridors, shoe soles, delivery packages and surfaces in the open air. Liu Xiaofeng, deputy-director of the Beijing Center for Disease Control, said on Wednesday during a conference briefing on Beijing's epidemic control efforts that such disinfection is an overreaction and not scientific, and it may also do harm. Disinfection is only necessary when there definitely or probably are pathogenic microorganisms or other harmful microorganisms that may cause transmission of infectious diseases. In normal natural conditions, the occurrence of an infectious disease is decided by the mode of contact with the pathogens (direct and indirect), the number of pathogens and the duration of exposure to the pathogens. Most of the microorganisms in natural air are harmless and do not transmit from person to person. For ordinary households, paying attention to hand sanitation and hygiene before having direct contact with food and after using the toilet is enough to ward off disease, while using disinfectants too often is not good for your health, as some beneficial microorganisms on the human body may be killed. Ultraviolet lamps are not recommended to the public either. Frequent disinfection should be applied to public areas or places often contacted by hands.","Beijing,transmission,infectious diseases,epidemic,pathogens"
2020/2/29,Are infrared thermometers harmful to the eyes?,"Infrared thermometers work by receiving the thermal radiation emitted by humans, not vice versa. Using infrared thermometers is not harmful to the eyes and body, according to Feng Luzhao, a researcher from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.",
2020/2/29,Can ventilators cause mucus clots?,"Scientists have debunked a recent rumor on social media which claims that ventilator could create mucus clots in the lungs of patients with the novel coronavirus pneumonia, thus suffocating them to death. The rumor cites evidence from a recently published autopsy report that revealed the virus mainly attacks the lungs and causes swelling in the air sacs. The report was published in the preview version of the Journal of Forensic Medicine last week. The rumor then claims that ventilator could create mucus clots in the lungs of patients and kill them. Therefore, the recent decrease in the number of deaths in Wuhan, Hubei province, was due to doctors replacing ventilator with machine that extracts mucus from the lungs. The rumor, widely shared on Twitter and Chinese social media Sina Weibo, has been panned by scientists and medical professionals. Liu Liang, the forensic doctor responsible for the autopsy, said in a recent interview that doctors need to reduce the lung fluid and keep the respiratory tract clean before administrating oxygen, or the gas might push the mucus deeper into the lungs and block the airways. However, Liu said the mucus clots are not created by ventilators but are symptoms of the disease. Moreover, cleaning the lung mucus is a standard procedure for all patients receiving the ventilators, and the machine has been a crucial piece of equipment that can save lives. The daily number of fatalities in Wuhan has dropped from 131 on Feb 23 to 37 on Friday. Qiu Haibo, a medical expert from the National Health Commission, said the decrease is due to concentrating critical patients into designated hospitals and giving them the best treatments available.","Wuhan,pneumonia,coronavirus,respiratory tract,Hubei province"
2020/3/1,Are protective measures needed in low epidemic risk regions?,"Some people think living in a low epidemic risk region means protective measures such as wearing a mask and frequently washing hands are no longer necessary. Low-risk regions are not risk-free, said He Qinghua, an official with the National Health Commission's disease prevention and control bureau. Taking personal protective measures is still necessary for people living in low-risk regions, especially those just downgraded from high- and medium-risk regions. People should avoid crowds, but if they have to go to a crowded place masks are strongly encouraged. Those working in an enclosed environment should wear a mask correctly, try to reduce working hours and self-monitor their health condition, He said.",epidemic
2020/3/2,Can realgar kill the novel coronavirus?,"Online rumors claim that realgar, known in Chinese as xionghuang, can kill the novel coronavirus. Realgar, a traditional Chinese medicine, is a mineral comprised primarily of arsenic and sulphur. No medical studies have proved that realgar can kill the novel coronavirus. Previous research showed that fumigating realgar in combination with three TCM herbs °™ aiye (mugwort leaf), baizhu (Atractylodes macrocephala) and baizhi (the root of Angelicae dahuricae) °™ can inhibit some bacteria, including those causing tuberculosis, diphtheria and typhoid. However, it has not been proven that the practice can kill viruses, and using only realgar has not yielded satisfactory results. The novel coronavirus is now known to be sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat and would die within 30 minutes at a temperature of 56 C. There are some chemical disinfectants that can kill the virus on surfaces. These include bleach/chlorine-based disinfectants, ether solvents, 75 percent ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform, according to the World Health Organization.","World Health Organization,coronavirus,novel coronavirus"
2020/3/3,Can drinking tea prevent coronavirus infections?,"An article claiming that drinking tea may help prevent novel coronavirus infections has raised questions among the public and academics. According to the article, researchers from the Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention found through experiments that in cells cultured in vitro, tea, which is rich in polyphenols, works well in killing the virus extracellularly and suppressing its intracellular proliferation. Based on this, the research team suggested that drinking tea could help prevent novel coronavirus infections. An immunologist told The Paper that the novel coronavirus infects alveolar epithelial cells. But the tea we drink won't reach the lungs anyway. Even if the in vitro experiments prove that tea can inhibit or kill the virus, it doesn't mean that drinking tea can do the same, said the immunologist. After in vitro tests, trials on animals should be conducted, and then human clinical trials can be considered. The results of in vitro tests are not enough to conclude that drinking tea can help prevent novel coronavirus infections, the immunologist added. The article, published by the WeChat account of Zhejiang CDC on Feb 26, has been removed. Staff from the center said the latest research findings will be published via the WeChat account after finishing procedures.","coronavirus,novel coronavirus"
2020/3/4,Can ultraviolet light kill the coronavirus?,"According to the latest guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of the novel coronavirus released by the National Health Commission, the virus is sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat, so ultraviolet radiation can effectively eliminate the virus. According to the guideline, indoor spaces should be disinfected with ultraviolet light with an intensity of over 1.5 watts per cubic meter. A UV lamp can disinfect objects within one meter for at least half an hour. Longer exposure to radiation is needed when the temperature indoors is below 20 C or above 40 C and relative humidity is over 60 percent. A room should be ventilated after UV disinfection, and people are suggested to enter the room half an hour later. Although UV is effective in killing the virus indoors, UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin, as the radiation can cause skin irritation.","treatment,coronavirus,novel coronavirus"
2020/3/5,Is spraying disinfectant needed everywhere?,"Spraying disinfectant over an area is not recommended as long as the place is less affected by the novel coronavirus. Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic, has been disinfected to kill the virus during the peak of the disease in mid-February. The move is not applicable to other less affected areas because the virus can hardly be transmitted through the open air. Instead, it is mainly transmitted via droplets discharged in close contact and is not able to keep alive for long while in the air. According to a guidance issued by the Chinese Center for Disease Control, disinfection of the open air is listed as one of the improper measures. It may backfire by polluting the air, earth, plants, underground water and even human body. Personal prevention measures are more effective than disinfecting the air.","epidemic,Wuhan,coronavirus,novel coronavirus"
2020/3/6,Can mother transmit virus to baby?,"An infant tested positive for the novel coronavirus only 36 hours after being born to an infected mother in Wuhan earlier in February. The news left pregnant women worrying about their unborn babies. Up to now, there have been no cases, including among SARS and MERS patients, proving newborn coronavirus transmission, according to Liu Zhaofen, a researcher with the Chinese Preventive Medicine Association. The infection of the Wuhan infant is still under investigation and the possibility of respiratory transmission has not been excluded. A pathogen can infect the fetus through placenta during pregnancy or through blood to a baby's broken skin or mucous membranes during delivery. A study published on the Lancet on Feb 12 cited nine pregnant novel coronavirus cases, all giving birth to living and uninfected infants. Mother-to-child transmission is still unproven as there are not enough clinical cases yet. Newborn infants should be quarantined for at least 14 days and avoid breast milk. Despite this, trying to conceive is not recommended during the epidemic as pregnant women are more vulnerable to the pathogen. If infected, a pregnant woman must take medicines which is good for the fetus.","Wuhan,cases,novel coronavirus,transmission,coronavirus,epidemic"
2020/3/6,Can recovered patients testing positive again transmit virus?,"Du Bin, a director at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, said there is currently no evidence that patients testing positive again after recovery from the coronavirus can transmit the virus. Tong Zhaohui, vice-president of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, said patients who test positive again after recovery from the virus are not ""reinfected"" or ""relapse"". They test positive again because a few number of the virus still remain in their body when they are discharged from hospital. And it needs some time for the virus to be eradicated from the body of some patients, especially from seniors.

Instances of the S type, which is older and less aggressive, has increased in frequency lately, thus possibly explaining the disease's slowing momentum in China. However, the authors noted the data examined in the study was very limited. How these mutations would affect the transmission and pathogenesis of the virus are still unknown. A virologist in Beijing who spoke on condition of anonymity said, ""It is still too early to say if the virus has mutated into something more sinister or more benign.""

As for packages, previous analysis has shown the virus does not survive long on objects such as letters and packages, so it's safe to receive packages from China.","outbreak,China,coronavirus,novel coronavirus"
2020/3/10,Eating garlic or Vitamin C helps keep the virus away?,"Although garlic is a popular flu remedy in traditional Chinese medicine and may have some antimicrobial properties, there is no evidence that eating garlic does help you fend off the virus. The same is true with Vitamin C. Many believe that Vitamin C is able to improve immunity, which health experts said is scientifically groundless. Vitamin C supplements are not an alternative to fresh food. For health people, it is not necessary to take extra supplements to prevent the disease as long as they get enough nutrition from a balanced diet. As for drinking hot water to kill the virus, it is only another misunderstanding. The novel coronavirus can be killed in water at 56 C or higher after 30 minutes, but it is impossible for human body to lift its temperature to 56 C. What's more, the virus infects the respiratory tract of human body rather than the digestive tract.

A coronavirus is only 10 nanometers in diameter and can only float in the air attached to other particles, like human droplets, which are much bigger. A mask can help stop the coronavirus if it stops the particles or droplets and a disposable surgical mask is good enough to do that. Cotton masks, thicker than surgical masks, have bigger pores, which may allow the virus in. Even if it is stopped at the outer surface, the virus may filter inside due to the absorbency of cotton after the mask turns wet during use.","coronavirus,transmission"
2020/3/10,Do pregnant women need to go to hospital for prenatal tests during the epidemic if the fetal heart rate is normal after home test?,"Fetal heart rate monitoring is just one of the prenatal tests. Apart from basic self-checks at home, women who are under 28 weeks°Ø gestation can postpone their checks in the hospital as appropriate during the epidemic if they feel no special discomfort. But they still need to go to the hospital when the pregnancy is over 28 weeks. Pregnant women should go to the hospital if they feel dizzy or dazzled, if they experience swelling, or if they suffer from diarrhea or sudden and rapid weight gain. In addition, fetal movement is also a very important indicator when self-monitoring. If fetuses suffer from early hypoxia in the uterus, their abnormal movements, rather than their heart rates, will be the first symptom in late pregnancy. A single check of the fetal heart cannot completely rule out whether the fetus is anoxic, so it cannot replace regular prenatal tests.","who,epidemic"

On Friday, Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Program, told a daily briefing in Geneva that there is no evidence right now suggesting COVID-19 will disappear in the summer. ""We do not know yet what the activity or behavior of the virus will be in different climatic conditions,"" said Ryan, warning against the assumption that the virus would just disappear on its own in the summertime like influenza. Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch also doesn't assume that changes in weather will make a big difference in how the virus spreads. ""COVID-19 has now been documented around the world. If the virus is anything like a typical flu virus, it may worsen in Southern Hemisphere regions as the seasons change,"" Lipsitch was quoted as saying in a story published on the National Geographic website.

An injection of gamma globulin is to transfer large amounts of the antibodies contained in the immunoglobulin into the recipient, who will gain a temporary immunity increase from a low or unprotected level. Immunoglobulin products are effective at preventing bacterial and viral infections. However, no evidence is available to prove that gamma globulin can prevent the novel coronavirus. What's more, the improper usage of gamma globulin can cause allergic reactions and side-effects in immune and blood systems.","plasma,who,coronavirus,treatment,antibodies,pathogens"
2020/3/12,Does patients' sweat transmit virus?,"The novel coronavirus is mainly spread through droplets discharged by patients and close contact with them but that does not necessarily mean through their skin or sweat, according to the latest study of the virus. Our inner body is protected by our skin from harmful microorganisms. ""Close contact"" means patients may discharge the pathogen on their hands or arms through droplets after they cough with their mouth and nose covered by their hand or arms. If we touch something the patients have touched, the pathogen may switch to your hands and get into mucosal tissue after we touch our eyes, nose or mouth with the affected hand. Do wash your hands carefully anytime and give special protection to any broken skin to prevent from the virus from entering your body.","coronavirus,novel coronavirus"
2020/3/15,Do we need to disinfect toilet to prevent coronavirus?,"As the virus has been found in the fecal samples of some patients, many people worry about the transmission of the novel coronavirus through toilet at their homes. At present, the novel coronavirus is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets or physical contacts with an infected person. Aerosol and fecal-oral transmissions are not the major routes of spreading. Aerosol transmission, in which the virus is spread after mixing with fine solid or liquid particles floating in the air, occurs in only extreme conditions - when people stay in a confined space for a long time and are exposed to high concentrations of aerosol, such as in health facilities. In a well-ventilated environment, the risk of aerosol infection is very low. Therefore, disinfection of the toilet is not needed if there are no confirmed or suspected patients at home. Recommended measures include sealing the toilet drain, covering the toilet when flushing, and improving ventilation and sanitary conditions.","confirmed,coronavirus,transmission,novel coronavirus"
2020/3/18,Can plasma from recovered patients give immunity?,"Transfusing plasma from recovered patients, which contain antibodies that are effective against the virus, is an unconventional therapy used to treat severe or critical cases of COVID-19 at a time when vaccines and specific medications against the disease are not yet available, according to the latest guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of the novel coronavirus released by the National Health Commission.  Although plasma therapy is effective on some severe patients, it doesn't mean that it can be adopted as a preventative measure for healthy people to gain immunity, said Wu Yuzhang, director of the Institute of Immunology of the People's Liberation Army.  Since the novel coronavirus is mainly transmitted through the respiratory tract, antibodies should be deployed on the respiratory mucous membrane to keep the virus from infecting cells. There is no evidence that the plasma from a recovered patient has such an effect, he said.  Also, the plasma from the recovered patients contain not only antibodies that are effective against the novel coronavirus, but also other types of antibodies, cytokines and plasma proteins, which may cause allergies and autoimmune diseases. What's more, plasma donated from recovered COVID-19 patients is in short supply and involves a complicated processing procedure and high costs, therefore it is not viewed as a viable method for healthy people to get immunity to the virus. For the general public, preventive precautions such as wearing masks and keeping a safe distance from others are better ways to prevent ourselves from getting the virus.","cases,respiratory tract,novel coronavirus,plasma,COVID-19,coronavirus,treatment,antibodies"

Some elderly who have underlying diseases may develop complications, and get severely ill, or die. Even for patients with mild symptoms, there is a risk of their conditions worsening suddenly, so treatment is necessary. Once the novel coronavirus has been detected, one should go immediately to the hospital for treatment.","who,treatment,coronavirus,novel coronavirus"
2020/3/20,Can freshwater fish transmit virus?,"Rumors have spread that freshwater fish are no longer safe to eat, as fish ponds in some regions are built along or over toilets and used to rinse chamber pots, which some claim could transmit the novel coronavirus through the fecal-oral route. First, no studies at present have shown the water-borne virus is infectious, so there isn't any chance people would get infections directly from fish. Second, different types of viruses can only infect certain species of hosts over a selected temperature range. For novel coronavirus, it mostly attacks mammals, including humans, that are endothermic or warm-blooded, and the average human body temperature of around 36 degrees Celsius is most favorable for the infection and reproduction of the novel coronavirus. But most freshwater fish cannot survive at this temperature, showing they can't catch or even transmit the virus. Cooking at a high temperature is recommended before eating freshwater fish no matter what, as the novel coronavirus can be deactivated after 30 minutes at a minimum temperature of 56 degrees. Good hand hygiene is, as always, needed after dealing with the ingredients.","coronavirus,novel coronavirus"
2020/3/21,Should I peel fruit before eating during the pandemic?,"Many people worry the coronavirus can contaminate fruit and believe only peeled fruits are safe to eat. In fact, as a type of animal virus, novel coronavirus is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and close contact. It is unlikely to survive on fruit or vegetables. There have been no reports of humans being infected after eating fruits or vegetables. Washing fruits with running water for 15 to 30 seconds can effectively reduce pesticide residue, bacteria and virus potentially present on the surface. There are many kinds of fruits whose skins are rich in nutrition. Grape skins, for example, contain resveratrol and anthocyanins that can protect blood vessels and strengthen immunity. Apple skin is an excellent source of dietary fiber and promotes digestion. The vitamin C it contains is a great antioxidant, which helps reduce the effects of aging. Therefore, it is both safe and beneficial to eat fruit with the skin on.",coronavirus
2020/3/28,Men more likely to catch novel coronavirus?,"Male patients comprise 55.9 percent of 6,013 cases collected from Jan 1 to 29, 2020, according to a study recently published by a research group from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University on an online academic platform. In addition, 47 of the 67 asymptomatic infections confirmed in their hospital are women, which show a higher ratio of severity in male cases, according to the study. The study pointed out that men are more likely to be transmitted by the novel coronavirus and develop severe symptoms. Researchers speculate that this may be due to the different immune mechanisms between the two genders. Men and women are inherently different in terms of responding to virus infections. Generally, on the premise of the same exposure to the virus, men are more likely to get infected with more viral load than women; whereas when faced with the same level of infections, women may have more severe symptoms and poorer prognosis. Women have a higher level of immune response than men, including both nonspecific and specific immunity, which enables them to get rid of virus more quickly but suffer from immune overreactions. For example, they often produce higher levels of antibodies and have more serious adverse reactions after anti-viral vaccinations. In addition, sex hormones and the varied levels of immune gene expressions also lead to the gender difference in immune responses. However, with incomplete data, it is still too early to define the gender vulnerability to the novel coronavirus and severity of symptoms between genders. The figures under study only cover the period of January, and there are undoubtedly cases of the virus that are not reflected in the data. More data and research are needed to make a convincingly final conclusion. Moreover, the study has not been peer reviewed nor formally published.","confirmed,Wuhan,cases,immune responses,coronavirus,asymptomatic"

The risk of transmission of COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person is also unknown. However, the risk is expected to be low based on data from previous outbreaks of related coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).

At this time, the risk of transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 through sewerage systems is thought to be low. Although transmission of COVID-19 through sewage may be possible, there is no evidence to date that this has occurred. This guidance will be updated as necessary as new evidence is assessed. SARS, a similar coronavirus, has been detected in untreated sewage for up to 2 to 14 days. In the 2003 SARS outbreak, there was documented transmission associated with sewage aerosols. Data suggest that standard municipal wastewater system chlorination practices may be sufficient to inactivate coronaviruses, as long as utilities monitor free available chlorine during treatment to ensure it has not been depleted. Wastewater and sewage workers should use standard practices, practice basic hygiene precautions, and wear personal protective equipment (PPE) as prescribed for current work tasks.","personal protective equipment,transmission,COVID-19,coronavirus,outbreak,treatment"

A shared mercury thermometer may carry the virus if it comes into contact with hands of infected patients if they leave their droplets on it. The shared thermometer used in hospitals and other public health institutes are disinfected after one use to kill the virus. Do remember to wash hands carefully and avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth with uncleaned hands as the virus may enter your body through these mucosal tissue.

2020/4/3,Can coronavirus be spread through the air?,"The virus that causes COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through ""respiratory droplets and close contacts"", and it doesn't seem to stay long in the air, according to a recent publication released by the World Health Organization. According to the publication on the WHO's official website, respiratory infections can be transmitted through droplets of different sizes. Droplet transmission occurs when you have close contact (within 1 meter) with a person who has respiratory symptoms such as coughing or sneezing, which may spread these potentially infectious droplets, typically 5-10 microns in size, to your body. Transmission may also occur by touching surfaces or objects in the immediate environment around the infected person. Airborne transmission is different from droplet transmission, as it refers to the presence of microbes within droplet nuclei, which are generally considered to be smaller particles of less than 5 microns in diameter, and which can remain in the air for long periods of time and be transmitted to others over distances greater than 1 meter. In the context of COVID-19, airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances in which procedures or support treatments that generate aerosols are performed, such as intubation within a patient's windpipe, disconnecting a patient from a ventilator, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). According to the publication, no cases of transmission by air were reported in an analysis of 75,465 patients with the coronavirus in China. Based on the current evidence, the World Health Organization continues to recommend droplet and contact precautions for those people caring for COVID-19 patients. And it's recommended that people take measures to prevent possible transmission by air when performing medical operations that produce aerosols.","cases,WHO,transmission,World Health Organization,who,COVID-19,China,coronavirus"
2020/4/4,Can novel coronavirus stay in the body for years?,"A rumor claims the novel coronavirus, the pathogen that causes COVID-19, can remain in the body of an infected person for years and requires lifelong medication, as with the infection of hepatitis B, where a patient is a chronic carrier of the virus. The misunderstanding was debunked by Hou Jinlin, an infectious disease physician with Nanfang Hospital in Guangzhou. Hou said COVID-19, an acute infectious disease, is totally different from hepatitis B, which is a chronic disease. For hepatitis B patients, antibodies are constantly generated to neutralize the viruses. If antibodies cannot be detected, it is because viruses are constantly replicating and antibodies are generated to neutralize them. Otherwise, it indicates viruses have been deactivated. For most people, medicine treatment can't cure chronic hepatitis B, only suppressing the replication of the virus. Therefore, most people who start treatment must continue it for life, according to information published by World Health Organization. COVID-19 is an acute respiratory disease, and the virus won't stay hidden for a lifetime in a person's body once the disease has been cured, Hou said. The novel coronavirus is usually cleared within 14 days if a patient has a strong immune system, and then antibodies will be detected. Hou added, however, a small amount of the novel coronavirus can still replicate after the antibody has been produced in a person's body, which means patients could still spread the virus to others. Therefore, the production of antibodies shouldn't be regarded as a standard for a patient to get discharged from the hospital. Patients in China can get discharged after two consecutive negative nucleic acid tests, taken at least 24 hours apart, and by exhibiting indications of clinical recovery, including body temperature, respiratory symptoms and CT lung screening, according to the latest version of diagnostic guidance released by the National Health Commission.","novel coronavirus,CT,World Health Organization,nucleic acid,COVID-19,who,China,replication,coronavirus,respiratory disease,treatment,antibodies"
2020/4/10,Can catkins spread novel coronavirus?,"Each year from April to early May is catkin season in northern China. People worry that these fluffy balls released from willow and poplar trees can spread novel coronavirus. But in fact, there isn't any evidence that viruses are contained in the catkins or pollen. The novel coronavirus is mainly transmitted by respiratory droplets, with particles that are relatively large in size. An infection is only caused by inhaling them in large amounts at a close distance. Aerosols, formed by dehydrated droplets that contain proteins and viruses, can float and spread in the air. But it is hard for the virus to survive without the proper temperature and humidity. It won't stay in the air for long. Even if the virus stayed on a catkin, its concentration level would be too low to cause infections. On the other hand, people still need to protect themselves from catkins as these pollen grains can cause allergies. For people with a sensitivity to pollen, inhaling catkins can cause nasal itching, sneezing, an itchy throat, headaches and allergic asthma - which in severe cases may lead to death by anaphylaxis. To fight pollen allergies, wearing a mask is recommended to prevent inhaling catkins. Other effective measures include immediate washing of the hands, nose and face after coming back in from outside, prompt removal of catkins which are indoors or attached to clothes, a bland diet, drinking plenty of water and increasing indoor humidity. When going outdoors, try to choose a time when there are fewer flying catkins and avoid wearing a coat with a fabric that collects the catkins.","cases,novel coronavirus,China,coronavirus,sensitivity"

2020/4/28,The SARS-CoV-2 was released as the result of lab accident at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.,"Established in 1956, the institute is the top virology research agency in China and home to Asia's highest-level biosafety lab. The institute's P4 biosecurity lab can handle the deadliest pathogens in the world. The laboratory is about 30 kilometers away from the center of Wuhan. It is impossible for the virus to leak from such a high-security laboratory, said Yuan Zhiming, a researcher at Wuhan Institute of Virology, in an interview with CGTN on April 18. He said there is no way the virus could have originated from the institute. Before accepting the first batch of test samples of COVID-19 patients on Dec 30, the institute's labs did not have the novel coronavirus. As of now, no one in the institute has contracted COVID-19. It is understandable that people would have speculation about the institute, he said.

In December 2019, Wuhan reported the first COVID-19 case, which was then called pneumonia of unknown cause. But scientists so far do not know the exact origin of the virus. Historically speaking, a place where a virus was first reported is often not where it had originated.

Li claimed seven people were confirmed to have contracted SARS, and reminded the group members not to further spread such information. However, the screenshots were widely shared on the internet. On Jan 3, the Wuhan police reprimanded Li and asked him not to spread SARS-related rumors as they might cause social panic. Li was not fined or arrested, and returned to his post with no further punishment. In mid-January, Li got infected while treating a COVID-19 patient, and tested positive for COVID-19 on Jan 31. He died on Feb 7 after arduous rescue efforts. On the same day, the National Health Commission sent condolences for his death. Doctor Li is not a ""whistle-blower"" in the sense defined by western media. He had never reported the situation to health authorities, nor openly warned the public. As a matter of fact, on Dec 27, Zhang Jixian, another doctor in Wuhan, already notified local authorities about an unknown pneumonia, and the government had been investigating the situation for three days before Li made his claims in WeChat.

2020/6/14,China detained Dr. Li Wenliang and other whistle-blowers.,"Li Wenliang was an ophthalmologist. He was not a whistle-blower and was not detained. Dr. Zhang Jixian, a respiratory doctor, was the first to report COVID-19 cases, and was awarded for this contribution. On the afternoon of 30 December 2019 (three days after Dr. Zhang Jixian reported cases of unknown infection and one day before Wuhan released the relevant information), Dr. Li Wenliang sent a message to his alumni WeChat group. He claimed that there were ""seven confirmed SARS cases"", and asked the group not to spread the information. However, leaked screenshots of the conversation spread quickly on the Internet and caused panic. On 3 January 2020, Wuhan's local police authorities asked Dr. Li to a police station for inquiry, and issued him a letter of reprimand as a means of persuasion. In mid-January, Dr. Li started to show symptoms of infection. And on 31 January, he was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19. On 7 February, Dr. Li passed away after all rescue measures were exhausted. On the same day, the National Health Commission publicly expressed condolences over his death. The National Supervisory Commission decided to send an inspection group to Wuhan to investigate issues related to Dr. Li. On 19 March, the inspection group released its findings and held a press briefing. Wuhan's Public Security Bureau announced the decision on the matter, pointing to the misapplication of relevant legal provisions in Dr. Li's case, and revoked the reprimand letter. On 5 March, Dr. Li Wenliang was named a ""national model healthcare worker in fighting COVID-19"". On 2 April, he was honored as a martyr. On 28 April, he was awarded the 24th ""May Fourth Medal"". Dr. Li Wenliang was a good doctor and a member of the CPC. Labeling Dr. Li Wenliang as an ""anti-establishment hero"" or ""awakener"" is highly disrespectful to Dr. Li and his family. It is pure political manipulation without decency. On 30 May, responding to the bills introduced by US lawmakers to rename the street outside the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C. ""Li Wenliang Plaza"", Dr. Li's wife Fu Xuejie issued a statement on Weibo that said, ""Wenliang was a CPC member. He loved his country deeply. Should he know about this, he would never allow anyone to hurt his motherland in his name.""","confirmed,Wuhan,cases,Washington,COVID-19,US"
2020/6/20,"China tried to cover up COVID-19, resulting in its spread across the world with over 10 million infections.","The Chinese government adopted the most comprehensive, stringent and thorough measures in the shortest possible time. The infections were largely kept within Wuhan with the chain of transmission effectively cut off.","government,Wuhan,transmission"
2020/6/25,"China has taken advantage of COVID-19 to conduct large-scale surveillance with big data, violating its citizens' privacy.","COVID-19 struck during China's Spring Festival, the annual travel peak on a scale rarely seen elsewhere in the world in this country with 1.4 billion people. This created unprecedented challenges for disease control. China has harnessed big data, artificial intelligence, 5G and other technologies, and devised a smart technology app called ""health code"" for virus containment. This app helped avert the risk of infection, and facilitated transportation and reopening of the economy. The ""health code"" app has been used in other countries as well, and tens of thousands of users downloaded it on the first day of its overseas launch. We have also noted that quite a number of countries have drawn on China's experience and practice in this regard in their COVID-19 response.","COVID-19,artificial intelligence,China"
2020/7/2,The Wuhan lockdown measures violated citizens' right to personal liberty.,"Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, was the first to report novel coronavirus cases. At the most critical moment against the virus, Wuhan enforced temporary travel restrictions in accordance with the law, which mainly include suspension of public transportation, such as city buses, subway services, ferries and coaches, and temporary closing of transport links, including airports, train stations and expressways. These important measures strictly contained the infections at the source, cut off the chain of transmission, and effectively forestalled massive spread of the disease. These measures helped reduce case exportation to other parts of China and the rest of the world, playing a positive role in the containment of COVID-19","Wuhan,cases,novel coronavirus,transmission,COVID-19,China,coronavirus,Hubei province"
